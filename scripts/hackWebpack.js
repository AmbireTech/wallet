/**
 * The typescript version of create-react-app is using the babel-loader to
 * transform typescript into javascript. The problem is that the ambire-common
 * npm package needs to be compiled. But the create-react-app webpack only
 * compiles ts|tsx in the `./src` directory (paths.appSrc).
 * One option to modify the webpack is to eject the create-react-app,
 * but another one is to simply modify the webpack config to include
 * the node_modules/ambire-common package as an exception.
 *
 * A bit hackish and might break if (when) react-scripts package gets
 * updated in future. So be aware!
 *
 * Inspired by {@link https://stackoverflow.com/a/63067008/1333836},
 * but modified a bit to do line change instead of line delete.
