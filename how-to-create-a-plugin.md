# How to create a dApp for the Ambire Wallet dApp catalog
_Basic Intro Guide_

[Ambire](https://www.ambire.com/) is a next-generation self-custodial Web3 wallet focused on the EVM ecosystem.

It brings to the table a number of innovative features like human-readable transaction parsing, simplifying ERC20 approvals, hardware wallet support and much more. It’s also a smart contract wallet, enabling features like multiple signers, account recovery, transaction batching, gas abstractions and others.

Ambire Wallet is an open source project. 

We are happy to announce the launch of our dApp catalog **integrated and developed on the Gnosis protocol** (Safe App).

### Why should you place your dApp in the Ambire Wallet dApp catalog 

We envision Ambire as the homepage of Web3 and this is why we created our dApp catalog. By adding your dApp to Ambire, you get the following benefits: 

- Getting in on the ground floor: the dApp catalog officially launched in Q4 of 2022 so you get to join our early adopters inner circle. 
- Tapping into the Ambire Wallet’s user base: we currently have 95,000+ registered accounts and growing. 
- Marketing support: Our experienced marketing team will work with you to help promote the dApp and your participation in the Ambire ecosystem.

### This document provide basic information about developing a dApp for Ambire Wallet

First you can get a Gnosis react template and start with application Gnosis Safe App React Template.

After that maybe you will need to get the current identity address and current network for the wallet session.

```
import { useSafeAppsSDK } from '@gnosis.pm/safe-apps-react-sdk'
...
const { safe } = useSafeAppsSDK()
const currentAddress = safe.safeAddress
const currentNetwork = safe.network
```

#### Example of how to send a transaction
```
import { useSafeAppsSDK, BaseTransaction } from '@gnosis.pm/safe-apps-react-sdk'
...
const { sdk, connected, safe } = useSafeAppsSDK();
const txs: BaseTransaction[] = [
 {
   to: '0x31415629...',
   value: '0',
   data: '0xbaddad',
 },
 //...
];
const safeTxHash: string = await sdk.txs.send({ txs });
```

#### Example of batching transactions
```
import { useSafeAppsSDK, BaseTransaction } from '@gnosis.pm/safe-apps-react-sdk'
...
const { sdk, connected, safe } = useSafeAppsSDK();
const txs1: BaseTransaction[] = [
 {
   to: '0x31415629...',
   value: '0',
   data: '0xbaddad',
 },
 //...
];
 
const txs2: BaseTransaction[] = [
 {
   to: '0x12214312...',
   value: '0',
   data: '0xabc123',
 },
 //...
];
const safeTxHash1: string = sdk.txs.send({ txs: tnx1 });
const safeTxHash2: string = await sdk.txs.send({ txs: tnx2 });
```

#### Example of gas estimation
```
import { useSafeAppsSDK, BaseTransaction } from '@gnosis.pm/safe-apps-react-sdk'
...
const { sdk, connected, safe } = useSafeAppsSDK();
const currentAddress = safe.safeAddress
const estimatedTransferGas = await sdk.eth.getEstimateGas({
   to: '0x31415629...',
   value: '0',
   data: '0xbaddad',
   from: currentAddress,
});
```

### Testing the application
You can run your dApp at this address: https://wallet.ambire.com/#/wallet/dapps

![Add custom dApp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83211172/216987050-641d8fae-6dfa-4dd5-9039-e355eee94dbc.png)

If you deployed your dApp on public address you can load it by click at “Add custom dApp” and fill address in modal form:

![Add custom dApp menu with example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83211172/216987890-f6a21da2-ecf1-4502-9603-f72e870b97ff.png)

If the dApp is loaded correctly then the user can start interacting with it.

### Balances provider
One of the main features that maybe you will need is to get the current balances (for most ERC20/BEP20/etc. tokens) for an account for the current network. We suggest using our own balance provider named Velcro.
```
https://velcro.ambire.com/v1/protocols/${PROTOCOL}/balances?addresses[]=${IDENTITY_ADDRESS}&network=${NETWORK_NAME}
```

For **PROTOCOL** you can use “tokens” or “nft”.

For **IDENTITY_ADDRESS** you have to use current Ambire Wallet identity address. 

For **NETWORK_NAME** you have to use one of Ambire Wallet supported networks:
- ethereum
- polygon
- fantom
- binance-smart-chain
- avalanche
- moonbeam
- moonriver
